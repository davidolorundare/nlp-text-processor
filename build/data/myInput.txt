I don't think I've ever written an Amazon review in my life, but after finishing this book I feel like I'd have to take out my frustrations somewhere.  To his immense credit, Andy Weir has re-invented Daniel Defoe's terrifically popular 1719 novel "Robinson Crusoe": a modern day "shipwrecked" explorer with limited resources but lots of ingenuity and technical know-how, fighting for survival in a dangerous environment. At first glance, it reminded me of Robert A. Heinlein's hard scifi stories, so I was pretty excited about reading it.
